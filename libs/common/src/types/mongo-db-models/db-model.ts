/**
 * This type gets the type of the MongoDB model
 * associated with a specific collection. If the
 * type for a specific collection is not defined,
 * the `WithId<any>` type is returned.
 *
 *
 * Note: `WithId<any>` was chosen as the default
 * because certain collections (such as `'deals'`)
 * have complicated type signatures that will
 * likely never be defined. Using `object` or
 * `Record<string, unknown>` for these types can
 * therefore result in many type errors which
 * would be complicated to fix. `any` is chosen
 * so that this type can be used for all collections
 * and not just the ones that we have fully defined
 * types for.
 *
 * @example
 * type UsersDbModel = DbModel<'users'>; // MyDbModel = PortalUser
