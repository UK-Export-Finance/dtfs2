# EXTERNAL API MICRO-SERVICE üì¶Ô∏è

The **EXTERNAL** micro-service primarily handles the consumption and communication with external APIs.

## Endpoints üåê

### 1. APIM

**APIM** provides various essential endpoints for various services (MDM, TFS, and ESTORE). **EXTERNAL** primarily interacts with MDM endpoints.

#### 1. MDM

Master Data Management (MDM) endpoints are responsible for providing a wide variety of critical data, ranging from `/currencies` to `/interest-rates`. To use these MDM endpoints, the **EXTERNAL** service requires the following three environment variables to be properly configured:

```shell
APIM_MDM_URL=
APIM_MDM_KEY=
APIM_MDM_VALUE=
```

Please note that `APIM_MDM_KEY` represents the header name, while `APIM_MDM_VALUE` contains the authentication code, as the "value" is applied to a "key" in the headers:

```javascript
headers: {
  APIM_MDM_KEY: APIM_MDM_VALUE;
}
```

### 2. Companies House

This endpoint is used for fetching CS entity data.

### 3. OS (Ordnance Survey)

This service interacts with the Places API from Ordnance Survey.

The service also hosts some external APIs for countries, currencies, and industry sectors. However, these should be removed and obtained through APIM API calls for better organization and consistency.

## Why

The primary reasons for creating the **EXTERNAL** micro-service are separation of concerns and reusability. By centralizing external API calls within this service, any external endpoint can be accessed uniformly from anywhere in the system. Additionally, it allows for consistent handling of requests, responses, errors, and other related concerns.

## Prerequisite üõ†Ô∏è

Before using the **EXTERNAL** micro-service, ensure that you have an `.env` file properly configured. You can use the `.env.sample` file as a template. Some sensitive variables may need to be shared within the team.

## Testing üß™

To run tests for the **EXTERNAL** micro-service, use the following command:

```shell
npm run api-test
```

This will generate test coverage as well.

### **Run a single API test**

If you want to run a specific API test file, you can use the following command by specifying the path to the test file:

```shell
npm run api-test "**/*/deals-party-db.api-test.js"
```

This allows you to focus on testing a particular aspect or functionality of the **EXTERNAL** service.
