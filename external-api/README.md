# EXTERNAL API MICRO-SERVICE üì¶Ô∏è
EXTERNAL is predominately responsible for external API consumption and communication.
## Endpoints üåê
### 1. APIM
APIM provides various crucial endpoints across varied services (MDM, TFS and ESTORE).
EXTERNAL has an high exposure to MDM endpoints.
#### 1. MDM
Master data management endpoints are responsible for providing wide variety of imperative data.
They range from `/currencies` to `/interest-rates`, EXTERNAL `.env` requires following three variables
to be fulfilled before any consumption.

```shell
APIM_MDM_URL=
APIM_MDM_KEY=
APIM_MDM_VALUE=
```

Please note `APIM_MDM_KEY` is the header name, whereas `APIM_MDM_VALUE` is the authentication code, since `value` is applied to a `key`.

```javascript
headers: {
    APIM_MDM_KEY: APIM_MDM_VALUE
}
```

### 3. OS
Places API
The service also hosts some External API for countries, currencies and industry sectors. These need to be removed and obtained through Mulesoft API calls.

## Why
Separation of concerns and reusability.
By having external API calls in it's own service, and external endpoint can be used from anywhere in the same way. It also allows us to gracefully wrap or map requests, responses and errors etc.

## Prerequisite
Make sure you have an `.env`. Use `.env.sample` as a base. Some sensitive variables need to be shared from the team.


## Testing
```shell
npm run api-test
```

Test coverage will be generated.

### **Run a single API test**
```shell
npm run api-test-file "**/*/deals-party-db.api-test.js"
```
