/**
 * Accordion component
 *
 * This allows a collection of sections to be collapsed by default, showing only
 * their headers. Sections can be expanded or collapsed individually by clicking
 * their headers. A "Show all sections" button is also added to the top of the
 * accordion, which switches to "Hide all sections" when all the sections are
 * expanded.
 *
 * The state of each section is saved to the DOM via the `aria-expanded`
 * attribute, which also provides accessibility.
