  <p class="govuk-body">If you answer ‘false’ to any of these criteria the Transaction can still be processed through this service. It requires approval from UKEF in order to proceed and will be referred to UKEF for further due diligence.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">The nature of the due diligence depends on which of the eligibility criteria are not met.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">If you answer ‘false’ to any of the eligibility criteria you must submit a completed Manual Inclusion Questionnaire.</p>
