  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" data-cy="compliance-status-heading">Compliance status</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body"data-cy="guidelines-wcag21">This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" data-cy="non-compliance-heading">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

  <ul class="govuk-list accessibility-statement-list">
    <li>
      On the ‘All deals’, ‘All facilities’, ‘Deal view – Deal’, ‘Deal view – Underwriting’ and ‘Underwriting – Pricing and risk’ pages, the visible label and
      accessible name do not match. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.3 (Label in name)
    </li>
    <li>
      On the ‘Activity and comments – Add a comment’ page, the form field is not labelled. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions)
    </li>
    <li>
      On the ‘All deals’ page, the text that appears within the account navigation section is announced by screen reading software as the current page, meaning
      screen reader users are not receiving the same information as it is visually presented. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)
    </li>
    <li>
      Under the ‘Contact us’ footer, the information is presented as a list, but isn’t conveyed that way to a blind screen reader user. This fails WCAG 2.1
      Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)
    </li>
    <li>
      When keyboard-only users and screen reader users visit a new page on the service, the focus position begins underneath the navigation menu. This means both
      sets of users may find it difficult to navigate to the beginning of a page. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.3 Focus Order
    </li>
    <li>
      Some of the visual headings across the service have not been tagged appropriately in the code, meaning screen reader users may be unaware that the headings
      introduce new content. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships)
    </li>
    <li>
      Some page titles that appear in webpage tabs are not descriptive. This means screen reader users may need to navigate the page first to understand its
      content. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.2 Page Titles
    </li>
    <li>
      Some of the tables presented across the service do not contain headers. This means blind screen reader users may find it difficult to understand the
      relationships of the columns data. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
    </li>
    <li>
      Some of the tables presented across the service are not semantically marked up. This means screen reader users may not be aware when new rows are
      introduced. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
    </li>
    <li>
      When adding an amendment, users must input a date. The three fields that presented are not programmatically related to one another, meaning screen reader
      users may have difficulty understanding that the date field inputs are related. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
    </li>
    <li>
      When adding an amendment, users must enter a new facility value. However, the currency value as presented (eg USD) is not announced by screen reading
      software. This means blind users might not know the currency value of the figure they are entering. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and
      Relationships
    </li>
    <li>
      On the ‘Check your answers’ page, voice activation users may have difficulty interacting with the ‘Change’ hyperlinks as they are not labelled as visible
      text in the code. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.5.3 Label in Name
    </li>
    <li>
      On certain pages across the service, headings are not structured, meaning screen reader users may not understand how the content that sits underneath the
      headers relate to one another. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.3.1 Info and Relationships
    </li>
    <li>
      Across the service, there is no skip to main content functionality. This means screen reader users must manually move past the navigation on each page
      repeatedly to access its content. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks
    </li>
    <li>
      On certain pages across the service, keyboard-only users are repositioned to the top of the page when interacting with radio buttons. This fails WCAG 2.1
      Success Criterion 3.2.2 On Input
    </li>
    <li>
      On certain pages across the service, there are non-descriptive hyperlinks that mean screen reader users may fail to understand their purpose. This fails
      WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)
    </li>
    <li>
      On certain tables across the service, some column headers contain sort functionality. Screen reader users may have difficulty seeing the sort function
      symbol, potentially causing confusion. This fails WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.1.1 Non-text Content
    </li>
  </ul>
