# Trade Finance Manager UI (TFM) :computer:

TFM, also known as Trade Finance Manager UI, is an internal application used for reviewing deals after they have been submitted to UKEF (UK Export Finance). It uses GraphQL to query the TFM API for deals and facilities, rendering the data using GovUK and MOJ (Ministry of Justice) design components, with some custom components as well.

## Purpose :clipboard:

The primary purpose of the TFM UI is to provide a user-friendly interface for reviewing trade finance deals and related information. The codebase of this UI should prioritize simplicity and clarity, minimizing the inclusion of complex logic or business rules whenever possible.

## Prerequisite :key:

Before running the TFM UI locally, ensure that you have an `.env` file configured. You can use `.env.sample` as a template. Some sensitive variables may need to be shared among the team.

## Running Locally :computer:

To run the TFM UI locally, follow these steps:

1. Execute `docker-compose up`.
2. Visit [http://localhost:5003](http://localhost:5003) in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can start all services from the project's root directory using `docker-compose up`.

## Login Credentials :key:

Login credentials can be found in the mock users data, specifically in the file: `utils/mock-data-loader/tfm/users.js`.
