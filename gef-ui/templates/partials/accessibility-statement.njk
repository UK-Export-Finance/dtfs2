    <li>you cannot modify the line height or spacing of text in tables throughout the service </li>
    <li>when zoomed in to 400% and selecting industry sector and industry class in the Bond Support Scheme and Export Working Capital Scheme application, the values are truncated which means they cannot be viewed in a single column </li>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons. </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations <h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">When the 'About the supply contract' page for the Bond Support and Export Working Capital Schemes is magnified to 400% and the width is set to 1280px, the select box options are truncated for industry sector and class, which means some users are unable to read the option fully. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.10 (reflow). We will continue to review any possible improvements we can make.  </p>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we're doing to improve accessibility<h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">UK Export Finance is committed to address all issues of the Digital Trade Finance Service/Portal. The team responsible for the service is working on the remaining accessibility issues, reviewing any further improvements which can be made.</p>
