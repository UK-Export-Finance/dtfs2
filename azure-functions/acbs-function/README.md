# ACBS - Azure Function App ‚ö°Ô∏è
Azure Functions are not platform-agnostic and work exclusively within the Azure cloud ecosystem. They are accessed through Azure's serverless compute service.

## Local Development :computer:

Azure Functions can be run locally on port 7071 using the Azure Functions Core Tools. This local environment enables testing and debugging before deploying to Azure.

## Orchestrating with HTTP Starter Function :electric_plug:

Durable Functions are initiated by an HTTP starter function, often referred to as `acbs-http`. This starter function triggers the execution of durable orchestrator functions.

## Durable Functions üîÑ

Durable Functions are an extension of Azure Functions, allowing for stateful orchestrator functions within a serverless environment. These orchestrator functions enable the orchestration of various functions over extended time periods. Orchestrations can persist their state, even in the event of disruptions.

## Application Pattern :rocket:

As of October 7, 2021, two application patterns are primarily used for durable functions execution:

* **Function Chaining (Linear)** üîÑ - This pattern involves executing functions sequentially, one after the other, in a linear fashion.
* **Fan Out - Fan In (Parallel)** ‚öôÔ∏è - In this pattern, functions are executed in parallel (fan out) and their results are then aggregated (fan in) for further processing.

## Queue Storage :file_folder:

Orchestrator functions utilize Azure Storage Queues to store and manage their state. Cleaning up queues when necessary is important to prevent unnecessary executions.

Azure Functions and Durable Functions play a critical role in orchestrating tasks, interfacing with external services (such as Mulesoft), and automating workflows within the Azure cloud ecosystem.
