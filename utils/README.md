# Utilities :wrench:

This section contains utility scripts and data for various purposes.

## Data Migration :arrows_counterclockwise:

The `data-migration` directory contains scripts designed to facilitate the migration of data from Portal V1 to Portal V2. For detailed instructions and usage, please refer to the [data-migration/README.md](data-migration/README.md) file.

## Mock Data Loader :page_with_curl:

The `mock-data-loader` directory contains mock data that can be used for local development and in non-production environments.

You can run mock data loader directly using

```shell
npm run mock-data-loader
```

or as part of the all-purpose

```shell
npm run load
```

command.

## SQL DB Seeder

The `sql-db-seeder` directory contains a script which seeds random data into the SQL database for utilisation reports.

You can run the SQL seeder directly using

```shell
npm run db:seed
```

or as part of the all-purpose

```shell
npm run load
```

command.

## Create Keying Sheet TFM Facilities

The `create-keying-sheet-tfm-facilities` directory contains a script which inserts data into the Mongo DB database to line up with the data inserted by the `sql-db-seeder`. This is needed as the "keying sheet" related functionality requires that the `FeeRecord` facility ids which are inserted correspond the UKEF facility ids in the Mongo DB `facilities` and `tfm-facilities` colletion.

You can run this script directly using

```shell
npm run create-keying-sheet-tfm-facilities
```

or indirectly via both

```shell
npm run db:seed
```

or

```shell
npm run load
```

## Validate Facility IDs

The `validate-facility-ids` directory contains a script which checks and compares the UKEF facility ids in the SQL `FeeRecord` table and the Mongo DB `tfm-facilities` collection to ensure that each entry in one database lines up with an entry in the other.

You can run this script using

```shell
npm run validate-facility-ids
```
