# The Rerun Command action is a custom GitHub Actions composite module designed to
# execute a shell command with optional environment variables and retry logic.
#
# This is particularly useful for scenarios such as flakey tests or intermittent runner issues,
# where a command might fail due to transient errors. The action retries the command a specified
# number of times before reporting failure.
