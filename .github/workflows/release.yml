# Release Workflow
# ****************
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow automates the release process for deploying web apps and Azure Functions to different environments.
# It is triggered by the completion of the QAT workflow and runs when there is a push to a release branch (matching the pattern `release-*` but excluding `release-please*`).
# The workflow handles the deployment of SQL migrations, web apps, and Azure functions sequentially.
#
# Key Stages:
# 1. Setup: Determines the appropriate environment based on the release branch and configures environment variables (e.g., timezone).
# 2. SQL schema migration: Deploys SQL migrations to the specified environment.
# 3. WebApp Deployment: Sequentially deploys a list of web apps defined in the matrix (`portal-ui`, `gef-ui`, etc.) to the target environment.
# 4. Function Deployment: Sequentially deploys a list of Azure functions (e.g., `acbs-function`) to the target environment.
#
# Key Points:
# - The workflow is triggered by the completion of the QAT workflow.
# - The deployment environment is determined dynamically based on the release branch (e.g. staging or prod).
# - Matrix strategies are used for deploying multiple web apps and functions iteratively.
# - Concurrency control is employed to ensure no simultaneous deployments for the same app/function.
# - Temporary deployment slots are used to ensure minimal downtime during deployments.
# - The workflow runs only if the preceding workflow (QAT) concludes successfully.
#
# Triggers: This workflow is triggered when the QAT workflow completes successfully for a release branch (`release-*`).
#
# Environment Variables:
# - `PRODUCT`: The product being deployed (e.g., `dtfs`).
# - `ENVIRONMENT`: The environment for deployment, dynamically set based on the release branch.
# - `TIMEZONE`: The timezone for deployment, passed via GitHub actions variables.
# - `FROM`: The base artifact to use for deployment (default is `latest`).
