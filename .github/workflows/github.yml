# This GitHub Actions workflow ensures that any pull request targeting the main or main-*
# branches meets certain criteria before it is merged. The workflow sets up the necessary infrastructure,
# configures the environment, and performs checks on the pull request title, body, labels
# and assignee to ensure that it adheres to predefined standards. If any of these checks fail,
# the workflow will exit with an error, preventing the pull request from proceeding.
