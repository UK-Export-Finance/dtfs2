# Workflow Name: Lint
# Trigger: Pull requests to the main branch that modify specific files (listed in paths).
#
# Environment:
# environment: set to dev
# timezone: retrieved from vars.TIMEZONE
#
# Setup Test Infrastructure:
# Name: Infrastructure setup
# Runs on: ubuntu-latest
# Outputs environment and timezone variables for use in subsequent jobs.
# Steps:
# Echoes the environment and timezone for verification.
#
# Lint:
# Name: Scanning
# Depends on: setup
# Runs on: ubuntu-latest
# Steps:
# Sets the timezone using the specified value.
# Checks out the repository code.
# Sets up the specified Node.js version.
# Installs dependencies using npm run ci:all.
# Runs linting using the command npm run lint:all.
#
# Key Points:
# The workflow focuses on linting, which checks code for potential errors, style issues, and adherence to best practices.
# It uses a sequential structure, with the linting job depending on the setup job.
# Environment variables are shared between jobs for consistency.
# The workflow leverages actions from the GitHub Marketplace for setting the timezone and installing Node.js.
