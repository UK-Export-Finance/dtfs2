# Deployment Workflow
# *******************
#
# This GitHub Actions workflow automates the deployment process for web apps and Azure Functions to Azure.
# It is triggered everyday at midnight when on base default branch i.e `main`. The workflow runs after a successful Quality Assurance - Tests workflow.
# completion and includes the following key steps:
#
# Key Stages:
# 1. Setup: Configures environment variables for the product, environment, and timezone.
# 2. SQL Database Migration: Deploys any new SQL migrations to the environment's SQL database.
# 3. WebApp Deployment: Sequentially deploys a list of web apps defined in the matrix (`portal-ui`, `gef-ui`, etc.) to Azure.
# 4. Function Deployment: Sequentially deploys a list of functions (e.g., `acbs-function`) to Azure.
#
# Key Points:
# - The workflow runs only after a successful Quality Assurance - Tests workflow.
# - The deployment environment is specified via environment variables (e.g., `feature`, `staging`, `prod`).
# - Matrix strategies are used for iterative deployment across multiple web apps and functions.
# - Temporary deployment slots are used to minimize downtime during deployments.
# - The workflow uses concurrency control to ensure that multiple deployments do not run simultaneously for the same app/function.
#
# Triggers: This workflow is triggered by a push to the `main` branch.
#
# Environment Variables:
# - `PRODUCT`: The product being deployed (e.g., `dtfs`).
# - `ENVIRONMENT`: The environment where the deployment occurs (e.g., `feature`).
# - `TIMEZONE`: The timezone for deployment logging and scheduling.
