# Key Points:
# The workflow focuses on source code analysis, including code quality and licensing checks.
# It uses a sequential structure, with each job depending on the completion of the previous one.
# Environment variables are set in the setup job and made available to other jobs for consistency.
# The workflow leverages actions from the GitHub Marketplace for specific tasks: Codacy for code quality analysis and Fossa for license scanning.
