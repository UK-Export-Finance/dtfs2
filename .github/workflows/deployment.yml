# Overview
# ********
# This workflow automates the deployment of web apps and Azure Functions to Azure upon successful completion of a QAT workflow.
# Key Stages:
#
# 1. Setup
# ********
# Sets environment variables for product, environment, and timezone.
# Outputs these variables for use in subsequent jobs.
#
# 2. SQL Migrations
# *****************
# Runs new SQL migrations on the environment SQL database
#
# 3. WebApp
# *********
# Runs sequentially for each web app defined in the matrix.webapp list.
# Sets the Dockerfile location based on the microservice (using the portal directory for portal-ui and the app's name for others).
# Builds and pushes Docker images using the root workspace as the context and the Dockerfile location specified for the microservice.
# Creates a temporary deployment slot using the FROM tag (latest by default).
# Swaps the slot to make the new image live.
# Cleans up the temporary slot.
#
# 4. Functions
# ************
# Runs sequentially for each function defined in the matrix.functions list.
# Builds and pushes Docker images for each function.
# Creates a temporary deployment slot using the FROM tag.
# Swaps the slot to make the new image live.
# Cleans up the temporary slot.
#
# Key Points
# **********
# Triggers on Completed QAT Workflow: The workflow only runs if the preceding QAT workflow completes successfully.
# Environment-Specific: Uses environment variables to tailor deployments for different environments (dev, feature, staging, prod).
# Matrix Strategies: Employs matrices to iterate through lists of web apps and functions for sequential deployment.
# Concurrency Control: Uses concurrency groups to prevent multiple deployments of the same web app or function from running concurrently.
# Fail-Fast Disabled: Allows all matrix jobs to complete even if some fail.
# Temporary Slots: Utilizes deployment slots to minimize downtime during deployments.
# Cleanup: Always removes temporary slots to maintain resource hygiene.
