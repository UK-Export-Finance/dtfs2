# This YAML configuration defines a GitHub Actions workflow named "PR" designed to analyse pull requests
# for staleness and take action accordingly.
#
# Identify: Uses the actions/stale@v5 action with parameters to mark pull requests as stale if
# they have been inactive for a certain number of days and close them if they exceed another threshold.
# This workflow helps maintain the health of the pull request queue by identifying and managing stale pull requests automatically.
